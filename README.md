# Population dynamics of sensorimotor learning journal club

This journal club covers recent papers that use dimensionality reduction approaches to understand population dynamics that relate to sensorimotor learning. Although the focus is on senorimotor learning, additional papers that also use similar approaches in different contexts (e.g., decision making, network communication, etc) can also be covered if they are of interest.

# Background reading

If you are unfamiliar with dimensionality reduction and how such methods have been used thus far in neuroscience, it is recommended that you first check out these papers:

Shenoy et al (2013) reviews the foundational work on dimensionality reduction approaches in motor control, and Cunningham & Yu (2014) give a much broader overview on dimensionality reduction methods in neuroscience in general. Gallego et al (2017) discusses the latest and greatest of how such approaches are used to understand motor control and learning.
